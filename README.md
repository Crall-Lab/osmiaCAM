# osmiaCAM

## Install Raspberry Pi software
Format SD card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

## Preview camera (to test focus, framing, etc)
```bash
rpicam-hello -t 0
```

## Take a single full resolution photo
```bash
rpicam-jpeg -o test.jpeg
```

## Setting up RTC
* Note: Requires access with internet
1. Connect RTC battery to slot labelled 'BAT'
2. check that clock is working with sudo hwclock -r
3. Run this: ```sudo hwclock â€”-systohc```
4. Edit configurations: ```sudo -E rpi-eeprom-config --edit```, modifying the two lines (if these variables do not exist, add them):
   ```
   POWER_OFF_ON_HALT = 1
   WAKE_ON_GPIO=0
   ```

## Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Crall-Lab/osmiaCAM.git
```
Or just download it as a zip.

## Create folder in /mnt/ called OsmiaCam
Put dayShift0.py, dayShift1.py, nightShift1.py into home directory ('~').

## Make mount directory
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/OsmiaCam
```

## Add lines to the crontab
Open up crontab with the following command:
```bash
crontab -e
```
Then add the following lines to the bottom of the crontab file if they're not there already (to get permissions and mount directory for external hard drive)

```bash
@reboot sudo systemctl daemon-reload
@reboot sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/OsmiaCam -o umask=000
*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/python dayShift1.py
*/3 * * * * /usr/bin/python dayShift0.py
@reboot sudo /usr/bin/python nightShift.py
0 21 * * * sudo /usr/bin/python nightShift.py
```
*NB if you want to use the camera (e.g, for preview, check focus, or to troubleshoot record.py script), turn off autoamted recording by commenting out that last line

## Check mounting location of external hard drive
run the following in terminal:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```
This will list mounted drives, and look for /dev/sda1 in last line.
Hard drives must be mounted at sda1. Do not connect other hard drives to pi.

## Testing
Restart and come back after 2 hours to check if expected files are in expected locations on hard drive. OsmiaCam should be created, with nestCam and ExtCam within. Each day will have each own folder within that. osmiaCAM will create 9 min 45 s video every 10 min of outside, 10s video of nest every 3 minutes during the day and every hour at night.
